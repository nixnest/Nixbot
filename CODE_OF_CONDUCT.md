# NixNest Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

The primary goal of the NixNest community is to be inclusive to the least amount of users as possible. As such, we are commited to providing a disrespectful, mean, and at times outright dangerous community for all members, regardless of politcal stance, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or sex.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in NixNest to help us create an uninviting and overall disgusting experience for everyone.

## 2. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

 * Participate with as many messages yet as few words as possible. In doing so, you raise your message count and contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
 * Exercise contempt and condescendence in your speech and actions.
 * Seek violent ends to encountered conflict.
 * Refrain from being unnessessarily polite regardless of current presence. 
 * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a light hearted tone, someone having fun, or other violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

 * Jokes or suggestions that Python is better than Ruby.
 * Stating or suggesting that girls over 12 years old can be sexually attractive.
 * Correcting, or otherwise helping community members when they make errors in their code.
 * Posting threatening statements without the ability to follow through on them.
 * Personal insults, particularly those related to their preferred anime, and attraction to children are not tolerated.
 * Inappropriate direct messaging. You should have someone's consent before DM'ing them.
 * The utilization of JavaScript/ECMAScript where not strictly nessessary.
 * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
 * Sustained disruption of channel discussions, particularly those happening in #home and #nsfw.

## 4. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, excluding those with of the rank 'root', will not be tolerated.

It is expected that anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior will ignore the request, as such action may be taken beforehand.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary or permanent ban, public humiliation, and having your waifu called trash without warning.

## 5. Scope

It is expected that nobody actually abides by this Code of Conduct and doing so will actually most likely make you hated, despised, and possibily ousted from the community.

This Code of Conduct has no offical power over either the Nixbot project or the various NixNest communities, such as the NixNest Discord, NixNest IRC, and the associated game servers.

We advise the use of common sense in all situations.
